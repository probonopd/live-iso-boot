The Debian Package live-iso-boot
================================

Usually systems are rescued with CD or USB stick. live-iso-boot makes
it possible to simply copy an ISO image to the harddisk and boot the
rescue image. This eliminates the need to carry around a USB stick
to rescue a system as long as the hard disk and the boot manager still
work.

live-iso-boot includes the script debian which is installed in
/etc/grub.d and run when update-grub is executed. The script looks for
ISO images in /boot/iso/ and adds an entry for each image found.

Howto
-----

- Get a recent live ISO image, e.g., from Ubuntu or debian-live
- Copy the image to /boot/iso
- Run update-grub
- Reboot and enjoy your new rescue system

Limitations
-----------

live-iso-boot uses the loopback feature of GRUB2, so it won't work
with legacy GRUB. Furthermore the distribution must support
booting from a loop-mounted ISO file, and live-iso-boot needs 
to guess some parameters based on the contents of the ISO. This
might not work for some distributions yet.


Create your own ISO
-------------------

You can make your own Grml Live ISO image using the grml-live
build framework. Visit http://grml.org/grml-live/ and
